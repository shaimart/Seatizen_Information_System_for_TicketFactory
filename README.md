# Seatizen_Information_System_for_TicketFactory

## Project Description

This is a collaborative student project developed by a five-member team. We simulate real-world client consultations through regular workshop-style meetings. Based on these sessions, we:

- Identify current challenges faced by TicketFactory  
- Define business goals and measurable KPIs  
- Translate requirements into a structured backlog  
- Distribute tasks across the team  

Our work includes documentation and process visualization using BPMN. We model both as-is and to-be scenarios and design optimized workflows to be implemented in a prototype.

Throughout the semester, we produce:

- An initial study with ROI calculations and system architecture proposal  
- A prototype of key UI screens (Figma)  
- Class diagrams, use case diagrams (UC), and BPMN process diagrams
